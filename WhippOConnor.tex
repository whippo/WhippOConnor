%************************************************
% Optional packages.
%
% The use of these packages is optional, but they provide various
% tools for more flexible formating.  The sample thesis uses these,
% but if you remove the example code, you should be able to exclude
% these packages.  Only standard packages have been described here;
% they should be installed with any complete LaTeX instalation, but
% if not, you can find them at the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network
% (CTAN): http://www.ctan.org/
%

%******** afterpage ***************************
% This package allows you to issue commands at the end of the current
% page.  A good use for this is to use the command
% \afterpage{\clearpage} right after a figure.  This will cause the
% figure to be inserted on the page following the current one (or on
% the current page if it will fit) but will not break the page in the
% middle.
\usepackage{afterpage}

%******** float *********************************
% This package allows you to customize the style of
% "floats"---floating objects such as figures and tables.  In
% addition, it allows you to define additional floating objects which
% may be included in a list similar to that produces by \listoftables
% and \listoffigures.  Common uses include introducing floats for
% programs and other code bits in Compute Science and Chemical Schema.
\usepackage{float}

%******** longtable *****************************
% The longtable package allows you to define tables that span
% multiple pages.
\usepackage{longtable}

%******** graphics and graphicx *****************
% This allows you to include encapsulated postscript files.  If you
% don't have this, comment the \includegraphics{} line following the
% comment "%includegraphics" later in this file.
\usepackage{graphicx}

%******** subfigure *****************************
% The subfigure package allows you to include multiple figures and
% captions within a single figure environment.
%\usepackage{subfigure}

%******** here **********************************
% The here package gives you more control over the placement of
% figures and tables.  In particular, you can specify the placement
% "H" which means "Put the figure here" rather than [h] which means
% "I would suggest that you put the figure here if you think it looks
% good."
\usepackage{here}

%******** pdflscape ********************************
% This allows you to include landscape layout pages by using the
% |landscape| environment.  The use of |pdflscape| is preferred over
% the standard |lscape| package because it automatically rotates the
% page in the pdf file for easier reading.  (Thanks to Joseph Shea
% for pointing this out.)
\usepackage{pdflscape}

%******** natbib ********************************
% This is a very nice package for bibliographies.  It includes options
% for sorting and compressing bibliographic entries.
\usepackage[semicolon,authoryear]{natbib}

%******** psfrag ******************************
% This allows you to replace text in postscript pictures with formated
% latex text.  This allows you to use math in graph labels
% etc. Uncomment the psfrag lines following the "%psfrag" comment
% later in this file if you don't have this package.  The replacements
% will only be visible in the final postscript file: they will be
% listed in the .dvi file but not performed.
\usepackage{psfrag}

%******** hyperref *****************************
% Please read the manual:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/hyperref/manual.html
%
% This adds hyperlinks to your document: with the right viewers (later
% versions of xdvi, acrobat with pdftex, latex2html etc.) this will
% make your equation, figure, citation references etc. hyperlinks so
% that you can click on them.  Also, your table of contents will be
% able to take you to the appropriate sections.  In the viewers that
% support this, the links often appear with an underscore.  This
% underscore will not appear in printed versions.
%
% Note: if you do not use the hypertex option, then the dvips driver
% may be loaded by default.  This will cause the entries in the list
% of figures and list of tables to be on a single line because dvips
% does not deal with hyperlinks on broken lines properly.
%
% NOTE: HYPERREF is sensitive to the ORDER in which it is LOADED.
% For example, it must be loaded AFTER natbib but BEFORE newly
% defined float environments.  See the README file with the hyperref
% for some help with this.  If you have some very obscure errors, try
% first disabling hyperref.  If that fixes the problem, try various
% orderings.
%
% Note also that there is a bug with versions before 2003/11/30
% v6.74m that cause the float package to not function correctly.
% Please ensure you have a current version of this package.  A
% warning will be issued if you leave the date below but do not have
% a current version installed.
%
% Some notes on options: depending on how you build your files, you
% may need to choose the appropriate option (such as [pdftex]) for the
% backend driver (see the hyperref manual for a complete list).  Also,
% the default here is to make links from the page numbers in the table
% of contents and lists of figures etc.  There are other options:
% excluding the [linktocpage] option will make the entire text a
% hyperref, but for some backends will prevent the text from wrapping
% which can look terrible.  There is a [breaklinks=true] option that
% will be set if the backend supports (dvipdfm for example supports
% it but does not work with psfrag.)
%
% Finally, there are many options for choosing the colours of the
% links.  These will be included by default in future versions but
% you should probably consider changing some now for the electronic
% version of your thesis.
\usepackage[unicode=true,
  linktocpage,
  linkbordercolor={0.5 0.5 1},
  citebordercolor={0.5 1 0.5},
  linkcolor=blue]{hyperref}

% If you would like to compile this sample thesis without the
% hyperref package, then you will need to comment out the previous
% \usepackage command and uncomment the following command which will
% put the URL's in a typewriter font but not link them.
%\newcommand\url[1]{\texttt{#1}}

%********multirow********************************
% Allows table columns to span rows
\usepackage{multirow}

%******** setspace *******************************
% The setspace package allows you to manually set the spacing of the
% file.  UBC may require 1.5 spacing for microfilming of theses.  In
% this case you may obtain this by including this package and issuing
% one of the following commands:
\usepackage{setspace}
%\singlespacing
\onehalfspacing
%\doublespacing

%function to make degree symbol
\newcommand{\degree}{\ensuremath{^\circ}}

%function to make superscript 2
\newcommand{\squared}{\ensuremath{^2}~}

% These commands are optional.  The defaults are shown.  You only
% need to include them if you need a different value
\institution{The University Of British Columbia}

% If you are at the Okanagan campus, then you should specify these
% instead.
\faculty{The Faculty of Graduate Studies}
\institutionaddress{Vancouver}

% You can issue as many of these as you have...
\previousdegree{Bachelor of Science, The University of Washington, 2011}
\previousdegree{Associate of Arts, Seattle Central Community College, 2009}

% These commands are required.

The assembly and persistence of ecological communities is a phenomenon that occurs across large spatial and temporal scales. However, the relative effects of regional versus local processes on community structure are not well understood in marine ecosystems. In order to understand how scale can alter processes that drive variation in community assembly it is necessary to determine patterns of diversity across multiple scales. Here, I used invertebrate epifaunal communities in the foundation species \emph{Zostera marina} to test 1) whether this marine community exhibits meadow-scale variability through time, and 2) whether we can identify patterns of connectivity and diversity within and among meadows in the same region. I found that seagrass epifaunal communities are variable in terms of their rarefied richness, alpha and beta diversity, and evenness among meadows. In addition, differences in these metrics were detected over the course of a summer season.
